                      Assembly Language Reference
                for the 80x86 Series of Intel Microchips

	This is a reference for the Intel x86 microchip series through the 
80486 (8086/8088, 80186/80188, 80286, 80386, and 80486.  At the time of
writing, a reference manual for the Pentium series (Intel's name for the
80586) was not available.

	In recent years, the PC microchips manufactured by Intel have been
referred to as the IA-32 (Intel Architecture, 32-bit) and IA-64 family.

	The information in this reference is adapted from the Borland Turbo
Assembler Quick Reference Guide (cite note).

NOTE: Hexadecimal numbers are given in C format.

Note: FROM HERE ON, MUCH OF THE INFORMATION COMES FROM "THE IA-32
	PROGRAMMER'S GUIDE, VOLUME 2: INSTRUCTION REFERENCE" (C) INTEL,
	PROVIDED FREE OF CHARGE.  THE INFORMATION, HOWEVER, ONLY DESCRIBES
	THE BEHAVIOR OF PROCESSORS UP TO THE '486.
	The Pentium and later processors essentially use the same format,
	with many added capabilities.

PART III: INSTRUCTION REFERENCE:


1) ASCII Adjustments: Operate on unpacked binary coded decimal (BCD) numbers in
	AX.  Convert to ASCII numerals by following the operation (and subsequent
	division, for AAD) with an OR AL, 0x30.

	AAA			; 37		[8086]	| ASCII Adjustment after Addition
	AAD			; D5 0A		[8086]	| ASCII Adjust before Division (Base 10)
	AAD imm8	; D5 ib		[8086]	| Generalized ASCII Adjust before Division
	AAM			; D4 0A		[8086]	| ASCII Adjust after Multiplication (Base 10)
	AAM imm8	; D4 ib		[8086]	| Generalized ASCII Adjust for Multiplication
	AAS			; 3F		[8086]	| ASCII Adjustment after Subtraction

	Description:
	a) AAA: If, because of a previous addition, the lower nibble (4 bits) of AL
		now contains a value greater than 9 (so it cannot be represented by a
		decimal digit), implement a carry: increment AH (which holds the next
		digit - this is unpacked BCD) and subtract 9 from AL.  The CF and AF
		flags indicate whether a carry was performed.  (The upper nibble of AL
		is cleared, regardless of whether or not a carry was performed.)
	b) AAD: Division cannot be performed on BCD numbers, so the unpacked BCD
		number (tens place in AH, ones place in AL) must be converted to normal
		two's complement form first: multiply AH by 10 (0xA) and add AL; the
		result is stored in AL and AH is cleared.  FLAGS{SF, ZF, PF} are set or
		cleared to reflect the result.
		The immediate form is undocumented; it performs the same operation with
		a base other than 10.
	c) AAM: Multiplication performed on unpacked BCD numbers may leave a result
		in AH that now needs to be converted from normal two's complement form
		to unpacked BCD form: Divide AL by 10 (0xA); put the integer part of
		the result (tens place) into AH and the remainder part of the result
		(ones place) into AL.  FLAGS{SF, ZF, PF} are set or cleared to reflect
		the result.
		The immediate form is undocumented; it performs the same operation with
		a base other than 10.
	d) AAS: If, because of a previous subtraction, the lower nibble of AL now
		contains a value greater than 9 (representing an invalid decimal digit),
		implement a borrow: decrement AH and subtract 6 from AL.  The CF and AF
		flags indicate whether a carry (borrow) was performed.  (The upper
		nibble of AL is cleared, regardless of whether or not a borrow was
		performed.)
	FLAGS{OF, SF, ZF, AF, PF, CF}: Some flags are set or cleared as indicated.
		The others ({OF, SF, ZF, PF} for AAA and AAS, {OF, AF, CF} for AAD and
		AAM) are left in an undefined state.

2) ADC - ADD with Carry Flag: Calculate the sum of the two operands and the CF
	flag (an extra 1 or 0), and store the result into the destination operand.
	This is used to propogate a carry across multi-byte or multi-word addition.

	ADC r/m8, r8	;		10 /r	|	ADC r/m8, imm8		;		80 /2 ib
	ADC r/m16, r16	;	o16 11 /r	|	ADC r/m16, imm16	;	o16 81 /2 iw
	ADC r/m32, r32	;	o32 11 /r	|	ADC r/m32, imm32	;	o32 81 /2 id
	ADC r8, r/m8	;		12 /r	|	(*) [ADC r/m8, sx(imm8)	;	82 /2 ib]
	ADC r16, r/m16	;	o16 13 /r	|	ADC r/m16, sx(imm8)	;	o16 83 /2 ib
	ADC	r32, r/m32	;	o32 13 /r	|	ADC r/m32, sx(imm8)	;	o32 83 /2 ib
	ADC AL, imm8	;		14 ib	|
	ADC AX, imm16	;	o16 15 iw	|
	ADC EAX, imm32	;	o32	15 id	|

	FLAGS{OF, SF, ZF, AF, PF, CF}: Reflect the result of the operation.

3) ADD - ADD two operands: Standard Addition - calculate the sum of the two
	operands, and store the result into the destination operand.

	ADD r/m8, r8	;		00 /r	|	ADD r/m8, imm8		;		80 /0 ib
	ADD r/m16, r16	;	o16 01 /r	|	ADD r/m16, imm16	;	o16 81 /0 iw
	ADD r/m32, r32	;	o32 01 /r	|	ADD r/m32, imm32	;	o32 81 /0 id
	ADD r8, r/m8	;		02 /r	|	(*) [ADD r/m8, sx(imm8)	;	82 /0 ib]
	ADD r16, r/m16	;	o16 03 /r	|	ADD r/m16, sx(imm8)	;	o16 83 /0 ib
	ADD	r32, r/m32	;	o32 03 /r	|	ADD r/m32, sx(imm8)	;	o32 83 /0 ib
	ADD AL, imm8	;		04 ib	|
	ADD AX, imm16	;	o16 05 iw	|
	ADD EAX, imm32	;	o32	05 id	|

	FLAGS{OF, SF, ZF, AF, PF, CF}: Reflect the result of the operation.

4) AND - Logical AND of two operands: Calculate the bitwise logical AND of two
	operands, and store the result into the destination operand.  Each bit of
	the result is set if and only if the corresponding bits of both operands is
	set.

	AND r/m8, r8	;		20 /r	|	AND r/m8, imm8		;		80 /4 ib
	AND r/m16, r16	;	o16 21 /r	|	AND r/m16, imm16	;	o16 81 /4 iw
	AND r/m32, r32	;	o32 21 /r	|	AND r/m32, imm32	;	o32 81 /4 id
	AND r8, r/m8	;		22 /r	|	(*) [AND r/m8, sx(imm8)	;	82 /4 ib]
	AND r16, r/m16	;	o16 23 /r	|	AND r/m16, sx(imm8)	;	o16 83 /4 ib
	AND	r32, r/m32	;	o32 23 /r	|	AND r/m32, sx(imm8)	;	o32 83 /4 ib
	AND AL, imm8	;		24 ib	|
	AND AX, imm16	;	o16 25 iw	|
	AND EAX, imm32	;	o32	25 id	|

	FLAGS{OF, SF, ZF, AF, PF, CF}: OF and CF are cleared, AF is undefined.
		SF, ZF, and PF are modified to reflect the result of the operation.

5) ARPL - Adjust RPL (Requested Privilege Level) of selector: If the RPL (bits
	0 and 1) of the segment selector in the destination operand is less (more
	privileged) than the RPL of the segment selector in the source operand, the
	RPL of the destination is increased to match the RPL of the source.  This
	instruction is generally of use to code that is part of the OS or other
	system software, to ensure that an application cannot request an operation
	that requires more privilege that it is entitled to, based on its CPL (the
	RPL of its Code Segment), but its use is not protected from applications.

	ARPL r/m16, r16		;	63 /r	[80286, OS, PM]
	FLAGS{ZF}: ZF indicates whether an RPL adjustment was performed.

6) BOUND - Check that value is within BOUNDs: Check that an array index, in a
	register, has a value that is within the bounds of an array.  The array
	bounds structure is a pair of numbers, in memory, that specify the lower
	and upper bounds (addresses), respectively, of the array.  If the index is
	not within the limits (inclusive), a #BR (INT 5) is generated; the return
	address is the BOUND instruction, which will be re-executed (hopefully with
	the index  now within bounds).

	BOUND r16, m16&16	;	o16 62 /r	|	BOUND r32, m32&32	;	o32 62 /r

	Introduced in the 80286 processor.  No FLAGS are changed.

7) BSF/BSR - Bit Scan Forward/Reverse: Scan the operand for the first bit that
	is set.  Scanning begins from the LSB (least significant bit, bit 0) for
	forward-scanning, or from the MSB (most significant bit, bit 15 or 31) for
	reverse-scanning.  The result is the index of the first 1-bit in the source
	operand; if the operand is 0 (all bits clear), the result is undefined.

	BSF r16, r/m16		; o16 0F BC /r	| Forward Bit Scan on r/m16 -> r16
	BSF r32, r/m32		; o32 0F BC /r	| Forward Bit Scan on r/m32 -> r32
	BSR r16, r/m16		; o16 0F BD /r	| Reverse Bit Scan on r/m16 -> r16
	BSR r32, r/m32		; o32 0F BD /r	| Reverse Bit Scan on r/m32 -> r32

	FLAGS{ZF} indicates whether or not a 1-bit was found.
	Introduced in the 80386 processor. FLAGS{OF, SF, AF, PF, CF} are undefined.
	
8) BSWAP - Byte SWAP: Rearrange the bytes in a 32-bit register, swapping bytes
	0 and 3, and bytes 2 and 4, switching between little-endian (low-order byte
	lowest in memory) and big-endian (high-order byte lowest in memory) form.
	(If the operand is a 16-bit register, the result is undefined.  To swap the
	bytes of a 16-bit value, use XCHG r8, r8 instead.)

	BSWAP r32		; (o32) 0F C8 +r	| Uses opcodes 0F C8 - 0F CF.

	Introduced in the 80486 processor.  No FLAGS are changed.

9) BT/BTC/BTR/BTS - Bit Test (and Complement, Reset, or Set): Check if the
	specified bit in the operand is set (equal to 1) or clear (equal to 0), and
	store the bit's value in the Carry Flag.  The base (first operand) is the
	address or location of the byte string containing the bit, and the offset
	(second operand) is the index of the bit within the string.
	After saving the bit's value, the bit can be: BTR - reset (cleared, or set
	to 0); BTS - set (to 1); BTC - complemented (negated: set if clear, or
	cleared if set); or BT - left unchanged.

	BT r/m16, r16	; o16 0F A3 /r	|	BT r/m16, imm8		; o16 0F BA /4 ib
	BT r/m32, r32	; o32 0F A3 /r	|	BT r/m32, imm8		; o32 0F BA /4 ib
	BTC r/m16, r16	; o16 0F BB /r	|	BTC r/m16, imm8		; o16 0F BA /7 ib
	BTC r/m32, r32	; o32 0F BB /r	|	BTC r/m32, imm8		; o32 0F BA /7 ib
	BTR r/m16, r16	; o16 0F B3 /r	|	BTR r/m16, imm8		; o16 0F BA /6 ib
	BTR r/m32, r32	; o32 0F B3 /r	|	BTR r/m32, imm8		; o32 0F BA /6 ib
	BTS r/m16, r16	; o16 0F AB /r	|	BTS r/m16, imm8		; o16 0F BA /5 ib
	BTS r/m32, r32	; o32 0F AB /r	|	BTS r/m32, imm8		; o32 0F BA /5 ib

	FLAGS{CF} contains the saved value of the desired bit.
	Introduced in the 80386 Processor. (FLAGS{OF, SF, AF, PF} are undefined.)

10) CALL - Call a subprocedure, pushing the return address on the stack for a
	future RET instruction.  The block of code being called may be in the same
	code segment (a near call), in another code segment of the same privilege
	level (a far call - this applies to all far calls in real-mode or V86-mode),
	in a code segment of a different privilege level, accessed through a call
	gate, or in another task, accessed through a task gate.  Near calls can be
	absolute (the operand contains the exact address of the target instruction)
	or relative: the location of the target instruction is found by adding a
	displacement (an immediate word or dword) to the address of the instruction
	immediately following the CALL instruction.

	CALL rel16	; o16 E8 cw		| CALL near, relative - PUSH IP, JMP [IP + cw]
	CALL rel32	; o32 E8 cd		| CALL near, relative - PUSH EIP, JMP [EIP + cd]
	CALL r/m16	; o16 FF /2		| CALL near, absolute - 16-bit addr. in reg/mem
	CALL r/m32	; o32 FF /2		| CALL near, absolute - 32-bit addr. in reg/mem
	CALL ptr16:16	; o16 9A cd	| CALL far - full segment/offset in 32-bit imm.
	CALL ptr16:32	; o32 9A cp	| CALL far - full segment/offset in 48-bit imm.
	CALL m16:16	; o16 FF /3		| CALL far - 32-bit segment/offset at r/m mem.
	CALL m16:32	; o32 FF /3		| CALL far - 48-bit segment/offset at r/m mem.

	For near calls, the (E)IP register, pointing to the first byte of the next
	instruction (IP if o16, EIP if o32), is pushed onto the stack.  Then, the
	the operand is either added to eIP (for relative calls), or eIP is set to
	its value (for absolute calls).  The CS register is unchanged.
	For far calls, first the CS register is pushed onto the stack (the upper
	word padded with 0's if o32), followed by (E)IP.  In real or V86 mode, the
	CS register is loaded with the segment part (16 high-order bits) of the far
	pointer in the operand, and (E)IP is loaded with with the offset part of
	the pointer (the low-order 16 or 32 bits).
	In protected mode, the segment selector part of the far call operand (which
	are the 16 bits lowest in memory) are an index to a descriptor (in the GDT
	or LDT) which MUST describe describe one of the following:
	a) A code segment of the same privilege level.  The target instruction is
		the offset part of the operand, offset to the base address given in the
		code segment descriptor.  The offset may not exceed the segment limit.
		The CS register and the (E)IP register are loaded with the selector and
		offset from the operand.
	b) A conforming code segment of a more privileged level (the descriptor's
		DPL is less than the CPL, bits 0-1 of CS).  The target is the specified
		offset within the requested code segment.  The CS and (E)IP registers
		are loaded with the selector and offset from the operand, except that
		the CPL remains unchanged.
	c) A call gate.  This is a descriptor that contains a code segment selector,
		segment offset, and parameter count.  The CS and (E)IP registers are
		loaded from the values in the call gate; the offset part of the operand
		is ignored.  If the permissions in the call gate (DPLs and RPLs of the
		gate and its indicated code segment) indicate that the CPL is to change,
		then a stack switch occurs: SS and (E)SP are set to point to the stack
		for the new privilege level (from the TSS), and the old SS:(E)SP values,
		the parameters, and the return CS:(E)IP values are copied to the new
		stack.
	d) A Task State Segment (TSS), or a task gate.  This is a descriptor that
		contains a pointer to a TSS.  Either of these indicate that the called
		code is to be executed as a different task, and a task-switch occurs
		(with nesting).  In either case, the CS and (E)IP registers are loaded
		from the values stored in the TSS; the offset part of the operand is
		ignored.

	If any of the permission checks fail, or if any segment, offset, or gate is
	invalid, an exception is generated.  In most cases, this is a #GP (INT 13),
	but it can also be an #SS (INT ?), #NP (INT ?), or #TS (INT ??).
	No FLAGS are changed, unless a task-switch occurs, in which case all FLAGS
	are restored to their previous values from the TSS.

11) Size Conversions: Sign-extend a smaller value to a larger value.

	CBW		; o16 98	| Convert Byte to Word: AX = sx(AL)
	CWDE	; o32 99	| Convert Word to Doubleword (EAX reg.): EAX = sx(AX)
	CWD		; o16 99	| Convert Word to Doubleword: DX:AX = sx(AX)
	CDQ		; 032 99	| Convert Doubleword to Quadword: EDX:EAX = sx(EAX)

	No FLAGS are changed.

12) FLAG Operations (1): Change the value of the specified bit in (E)FLAGS.
	Only the specified flag bit is changed; all others are left unmodified.

	CLC		; F8	| Clear Carry Flag: CF = 0
	CLD		; FC	| Clear Direction Flag: DF = 0 (String instructions advance)
	CLI		; FA	| Clear Interrupt-enable Flag: IF = 0 (disable interrupts)
	CMC		; F5	| Complement Carry Flag: CF = ~CF
	CLTS	; 0F 06	| Clear Task-switched (TS) flag (bit 3 of CR0/MSW)

	The IF (Interrupt-enabled Flag) can only be changed if the CPL is at least
	as privileged as the IOPL (CPL <= IOPL).  (IOPL is bits 12-13 of (E)FLAGS.)
	The TS flag is set when a task-switch occurs, to enable the OS to save the
	x87 state in the TSS.  It can only be cleared by code running at a CPL of 0.

13) CMP - CoMPare two operands: Calculate the difference of the first and the
	second operand.  Do not store the result, just reflect it in the state of
	the processor status flags.  This is generally followed by an instruction
	that is conditional on the state of the flags, such as conditional jumps.

	CMP r/m8, r8	;		38 /r	|	CMP r/m8, imm8		;		80 /7 ib
	CMP r/m16, r16	;	o16 39 /r	|	CMP r/m16, imm16	;	o16 81 /7 iw
	CMP r/m32, r32	;	o32 39 /r	|	CMP r/m32, imm32	;	o32 81 /7 id
	CMP r8, r/m8	;		3A /r	|	(*) [ADC r/m8, sx(imm8)	;	82 /7 ib]
	CMP r16, r/m16	;	o16 3B /r	|	CMP r/m16, sx(imm8)	;	o16 83 /7 ib
	CMP	r32, r/m32	;	o32 3B /r	|	CMP r/m32, sx(imm8)	;	o32 83 /7 ib
	CMP AL, imm8	;		3C ib	|
	CMP AX, imm16	;	o16 3D iw	|
	CMP EAX, imm32	;	o32	3D id	|

	FLAGS{OF, SF, ZF, AF, PF, CF}: Reflect the result of the operation.

14) CMPS - CoMPare String operands: Compare two data items and set the FLAGS
	based on the result.  The bytes, words, or double-words at DS:(E)SI and
	ES:(E)DI are compared, the FLAGS being set accordingly but the difference
	being otherwise discarded.  The index registers (E)SI and (E)DI are then
	advanced to point to the next element in the string.

	CMPS m8, m8		;		A6		|	CMPSB		;		A6
	CMPS m16, m16	;	o16 A7		|	CMPSW		;	o16	A7
	CMPS m32, m32	;	o32 A7		|	CMPSD		;	o32 A7

	The operands are always the index registers DS:(E)SI (the DS segment register
	can be overriden by the appropriate segment override prefix) and ES:(E)DI
	(the ES segment register cannot be overriden), which must have been
	pre-loaded with the correct addresses.  The operand versions merely allow
	the assembler to choose the correct instruction based on the original
	definition of the data objects.

	After comparing the data, the index registers are advanced to the next
	element in the string: by 1 for CMPSB, 2 for CMPSW, or 4 for CMPSD.  The
	direction of this advance is based on the Direction Flag (DF): forward if
	the flag is clear, or backward if the flag is set.  The set of registers
	are the 16-bit SI/DI if the address-size attribute is 16 bits, or the 32-bit
	ESI/EDI if the address-size attribute is 32 bits.

	CMPS can be preceded by a REPE/REPZ (0xF3) or REPNE/REPNZ (0xF2) prefix, to
	continually compare elements in a string.  At each repetition, the (E)CX
	register is decremented, the loop ending when it reaches 0 or the condition
	fails (ZF is set/clear based on the comparison).  The JeCXZ instruction can
	be used to differentiate between the two cases.

	FLAGS{OF, SF, ZF, AF, PF, CF}: Reflect the result of the comparison.

15) CMPXCHG - CoMPare and eXCHanGe: Implement the basic semaphore lock
	operation, comparing the accumulator (AL, AX, or EAX) with the destination
	(first) operand.  If they are the same, the destination operand is loaded
	with the value from the source (second) operand.  If they are not the same,
	the accumulator is loaded from the destination operand so they are now the
	same.  This is commonly used as the atomic synchronization operation.

	CMPXCHG r/m8, r8	;		0F B0 /r	| AL == r/m ? r/m = r : AL = r/m
	CMPXCHG r/m16, r16	;	o16 0F B1 /r	| AX == r/m ? r/m = r : AX = r/m
	CMPXCHG r/m32, r32	;	o32 0F B1 /r	| EAX == r/m ? r/m = r : EAX = r/m

	FLAGS{OF, SF, ZF, AF, PF, CF}: Reflect the result of the comparison.
	ZF being set after the instruction means that the destination was loaded.
	This instruction was introduced in the 80486 processor.
	Note: It seems that on the '486, the opcodes may have been 0F A6 and 0F A7.

16) Decimal Adjustments: Operate on packed 2-digit BCD (binary coded decimal)
	numbers in AL.  An ADD or SUB instruction on packed BCD may leave a value in
	AL that is no longer valid BCD; these instructions correct the result.

	DAA			; 27		[8086]	| Decimal Adjustment after Addition
	DAS			; 2F		[8086]	| Decimal Adjustment after Subtraction

	Description:
	a) DAA: If (as a result of an addition) either nibble (4 bits) of AL now
		contains a value greater than 9, perform a carry as appropriate.  For
		each nibble, the AF flag (indicating a carry out of the lower nibble in
		the previous operation) or the CF flag (indicating a previous carry out
		of the upper nibble) is checked, and the carry is performed regardless
		of the value in that nibble.  The operation is as follows:
			if (AL & 0x0F > 0x09 || AF) AL += 6, AF = 1;
			if (AL & 0xF0 > 0x90 || CF) AL += 0x60, CF = 1;
	b) DAS: If (as a result of a packed BCD subtraction) either nibble of AL
		needs to be adjusted so it does not contain a value greater than 9,
		perform borrows as appropriate.  For each nibble, the AF flag
		(indicating a borrow for the lower nibble of AL was needed) or the CF
		flag (indicating a borrow for the upper nibble was needed) is also
		checked.  The operation is as follows:
			if (AL & 0x0F > 0x09 || AF) AL -=6, AF = 1;
			if (AL & 0xF0 > 0x90 || CF) AL -= 0x60, CF = 1;
	FLAGS{OF, SF, ZF, AF, PF, CF}: {AF, CF} are set as indicate,; {SF, ZF, PF}
		reflect the result of the operation, and {OF} is undefined.

17) DEC - DECrement operand by 1.  The operand is both source and destination.

	DEC r/m8	;		FE /1		|	DEC r16		;	o16 48 +iw
	DEC r/16	;	o16 FF /1		|	DEC r32		;	o32 48 +rd
	DEC r/m32	;	o32 FF /1		|	// Uses opcodes 0x48 through 0x4F

	FLAGS{OF, SF, ZF, AF, PF}: Reflect the result of the operation.
	Note: The Carry Flag (CF) is not modified by this instruction.

18) DIV - Unsigned DIVide: Divide the extended accumulator pair (AH:AL, DX:AX,
	or EDX:EAX) by the operand, and store the result back into the extended
	accumulator: the (truncated) quotient in the accumulator (AL, AX, or EAX),

19) ENTER - Construct a stack frame upon ENTERing a procedure: This instruction
	sets up a stack frame for a procedure, allocating space on the stack for
	local (automatic) variables and, optionally, copying previous frame pointers
	to allow a nested function access to the local variables and stack frame of
	the calling function.
	First, the current (caller's) frame pointer is saved (PUSHed) on the stack,
	so it can be recovered by a corresponding LEAVE instruction.  The value of
	the stack pointer (SP or ESP, for 16-bit and 32-bit stack-size attribute,
	respectively) at this point is the current procedure's frame pointer, and
	will be the value of the frame pointer register (BP/EBP) through the course
	of this function.
	Then, for each nesting level above 1, a frame pointer is copied from the
	caller's frame to the current frame by being pushed onto the stack, and
	lastly (for nesting level 1) the current frame pointer is pushed onto the
	stack, so it can in turn be accessed by a more deeply nested procedure.  The
	stack pointer (SP/ESP) is updated appropriately.
	Finally, the frame pointer register (BP/EBP) is loaded with the current
	procedure's	frame pointer, and space for local storage is allocated on the
	stack by decrementing the stack pointer by the number given in the first
	operand.  The layout of the frame is thus:
	(a) Positive offsets from the frame pointer - Arguments passed on the stack
		to this procedure, if any (depending on the calling mechanism).
	(b) Just above the frame pointer - the return address of the caller.
	(c) At the frame pointer - The saved caller's frame pointer.
	(d) Negative offsets from the frame pointer, up to the nesting level (for
		nesting levels greater than 0) - Frame pointers of previous callers, the
		highest in the nesting hierarchy right below the frame pointer, with
		deeper nesting levels lower until the current frame pointer furthest
		from the frame pointer.
	(e) Negative offsets from the frame pointer, with offsets greater than the
		nesting level - local memory storage, allocated on the stack.
	(f) The current top of stack, which the stack pointer currently points to,
		and the stack available for any subsequent use.
	The stack-size attribute (address-size of the SS register) indicates whether
	SP or ESP is used as the stack pointer, and whether BP or EBP is used as the
	frame pointer.  The operand-size attribute (which may be overriden by an
	operand-size override prefix) specifies the size, 16 or 32 bits, of each
	value PUSHed onto the stack.

	ENTER imm16, imm8	;	C8 iw ib	|	(ib is masked to 5 bits)

	The first operand (imm16) is the number of bytes of local storage to
	allocate.  The second operand (imm8) is the nesting level; it is masked to
	5 bits, giving a maximum nesting level of 31.

	No FLAGS are modified by this instruction.

20) HLT - HaLT the processor: The processor stops executing any further
	instructions and may enter a HALT state.  An external interrupt (or NMI, if
	interrupts are disabled) or certain signals cause the processor to resume

	This instruction is privileged, and may only be executed by code running at
	a CPL of 0.

	After comparing the data, the index registers are advanced to the next
	element in the string: by 1 for CMPSB, 2 for CMPSW, or 4 for CMPSD.  The

80) XOR - Logical eXclusive OR: Calculate the logical exclusive OR of the two
	operands and store the result in the destination (first) operand.  Each bit
	of the result is set if and only if exactly one of the corresponding bits of
	the two operands is set.
