<h3 name="PartI">PART I - INSTRUCTION FORMAT:</h3>

<ol type="A"><li value="1">
	<h4 id="Format">Format of Machine Code Instruction</h4>
</li></ol>
<pre>
A) The format of a machine code instruction for the 80x6 includes several
	fields containing opcode information.  The are as follows:

	1) Instruction Prefix		- 1 byte, optional
	2) Address-size Override	- 1 byte (0x67), optional
	3) Operand-size Override	- 1 byte (0x66), optional
	4) Segment Override			- 1 byte, optional
	5) Instruction Opcode		- 1 or 2 bytes (required)
	6) ModR/M (Address)			- 1 byte, required for some instructions.
	7) SIB (Extended Address)	- 1 byte, required by some ModR/M codes
	8) Displacement				- 1, 2, or 4 bytes, depending on ModR/M
	9) Immediate				- 1, 2, or 4 bytes, sometimes required

	The presence of the ModR/M, Displacement, and Immediate fields
	depends on the opcode.  The presence of the SIB field (and sometimes
	the Displacement field) depends on the value of the ModR/M field.
	(Values for the ModR/M and SIB fields are shown in Part I:E.)

	The Address-size Override, Operand-size Override, and SIB fields are
	only used by the '386 and later processors, as are the 4-byte forms
	of the Displacement and Immediate fields.
</pre>

<ol type="A"><li value="2">
	<h4 id="Prefix">Instruction Prefix</h4>
</li></ol>
<pre>
B) Instruction Prefix:
	0xF3 - REP (repeat) prefix, when used with forms of the INSx, OUTSx,
		LODSx, STOSx, and MOVSx string instructions
	0xF3 - REPE/REPZ prefix, when used with forms of the CMPSx and SCASx
		string instructions
	0xF2 - REPNE/REPNZ prefix, used with forms of the CMPSx and SCASx
		string instructions
	... where (x) means Byte, Word, or Double-word.
	0xF0 - LOCK prefix for memory synchronization.  From the '386 on,
		this may only be used with certain instructions.
	For more details, see the entries on the LOCK and REPx instructions.
</pre>

<ol type="A"><li value="3">
	<h4 id="Overrides">Address-size and Operand-size Overrides</h4>
</li></ol>
<pre>
C) Address-size and Operand-size Overrides ('386 and above only):
	In real mode and virtual-8086, the default operand size is 16 bits,
	as is the default address size.  This means that instructions will
	operate on the word registers (AX, CX, DX, BX, etc.), rather than on
	the double-word (32-bit) registers (EAX, ECX, EDX, EBX, etc.).  In
	protected mode, the default address and operand size depend on the
	D-bit (bit 54) of the code segment (CS) selector: if the bit is
	clear (0), the default operand/address size is 16-bit; if the bit is
	set (1), the default operand/address size is 32-bit.  The Override
	prefixes, 0x66 (Operand) and 0x67 (Address), changes the size of the
	operand or address size used by the following instruction, from
	16-bit to 32-bit and vice versa.  A real-mode program using the
	extended 32-bit registers would therefore need to prefix each
	instruction by 0x66, the Operand-size Override.

	For instructions that use the stack (e.g. PUSH, POP, etc.), the
	default address size depends on the B-bit (bit 54) ofr the SS
	selector.  (This is the same bit as the D-bit of executable
	segments.  For Stack Segment selectors, Intel refers to it as the
	B-bit instead.)  When the bit is clear or the processor is running
	in real mode, the default address-size of 16 bits means that PUSH,
	POP, and similar instructions with use the 16-bit SP register as the
	stack pointer, to be incremented or decremented by the operand size
	(2 or 4 bytes).  If the B-bit is set, however, the 32-bit ESP
	register is used as the stack pointer.  The Address-size Override
	prefix, 0x67, is used to override the default, from 16-bit to 32-bit
	and vice versa.

	Note that PUSHing or POPping a 16-bit operand on the stack can cause
	the stack to become unaligned on double-word boundaries, which may
	have negative performance costs.  See more information in the
	entries for the PUSH and POP instructions.
</pre>

<ol type="A"><li value="4">
	<h4 id="Segments">Segment Override</h4>
</li></ol>
<pre>
D) Segment Override:
	Most instructions use a certain segment selector register by default
	for their operands.  In many cases, this default can be overriden by
	the use of the following Segment Override prefixes:
		0x26 - ES segment override			0x2E - CS segment override
		0x36 - SS segment override			0x3E - DS segment override
		0x64 - FS segment override ('386 and above only)
		0x65 - GS segment override ('386 and above only)

	The default segment selectors are:
	* The instruction pointer (IP/EIP), used to locate the next
		instruction, always uses the CS register.  No override is
		possible.  (Note that eIP is never used explicitly.)
	* The stack pointer (SP/ESP) always uses the SS register.  No
		override is possible.  (Note that eSP is not used explicitly.)
	* The stack frame pointer (BP/EBP) uses the SS register.  This can
		be overridden through the use of the appropriate segment
		override prefix.
	* In string instructions with two indices (CMPSx, INSx, MOVSx, and
		STOSx), the destination index register (DI/EDI) uses the ES
		segment register.  This cannot be overridden, as the override
		prefix will apply to the source index (SI/ESI) register.
	* All other memory accesses use the DS segment register by default.
		This can be overridden by through the use of the appropriate
		segment override prefix.
	* Other uses of ES, and any uses of FS or GS, require the
		appropriate segment override prefix.
</pre>

<ol type="A"><li value="5">
	<h4 id="ModRM">The ModR/M and Displacement Fields</h4>
</li></ol>
<pre>
E) The ModR/M and Displacement Fields:
	The ModR/M byte specifies the operands, in registers or in memory,
	upon which the instruction is to operate. It is divided into 3 bit
	fields:
		+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
		|  mod  |    reg    |    r/m    |
		+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
	Bit:  7   6   5   4   3   2   1   0
	1) Bits 7 and 6 - the mod field - combine with the r/m field to form
		a combined 5-bit field (see below).
	2) Bits 5, 4, and 3 - the reg field - specifies either a register to
		be used as an operand (of a two-operand instruction) or a 3-bit
		opcode extension (for many one-operand instructions).  Each
		instruction specifies which of the two meanings is used in its
		particular case.
	3) Bits 2, 1, and 0 - the r/m field - combine with the 2 bits of the
		mod field to form 32 possible addresing modes for the instuction
		operand, including 8 general-purpose registers (when the mod
		field has a value of 11b) and 24 indexing modes.  These
		addressing modes are listed in the tables below.
		The 24 indexing modes are different in the 2-bit addressing mode
		of the '386 and later processors.  In particular, certain
		encodings indicate the presence of an extended addressing field,
		encoded in the SIB byte.

	TABLE 1: 16-bit addressing modes of the combined mod and r/m fields
	TABLE 2: 32-bit addressing modes of the combined mod and r/m fields
	(1) sreg is used only in certain forms of the MOV instruction
	(2) disp8 means an 8-bit (1 byte) displacement, sign extended and
		added to the index
	(3) disp16 means a 16-bit (2 byte) displacement, added to the index
	(4) disp32 means a 32-bit (4 byte) displacement, added to the index
	(5) [--][--] specifies the presence of an SIB byte (see below)
	Note that the negative displacement are perfectly valid and useful.
</pre>

<ol type="A"><li value="6">
	<h4 id="SIB">The SIB Byte</h4>
</li></ol>
<pre>
F) The SIB Byte ('386 and above only):
	On the 32-bit processors, certain encodings of the ModR/M byte
	indicate that a scale factor be used to calculate the address of a
	memory operand.  These encodings are:
		(1) 00xxx011b - Memory operand is specified by SIB byte
		(2) 01xxx011b - Address calculated by SIB + 8-bit displacement
		(3) 10xxx011b - Address calculated by SIB + 32-bit displacement
	Like the ModR/M byte, the SIB byte is divided into 3 bit fields:
		+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
		|   SS  |   index   |    base   |
		+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
	Bit:  7   6   5   4   3   2   1   0
	1) The SS field (bits 7 and 6) indicate the scale factor, in powers
		of 2, of the the index register.  Values of 00, 01, 10, and 11
		indicate that the value of the register specified by the index
	2) The index field (bits 5, 4, and 3) indicate the general-purpose
		register (except ESP, which cannot be used as an index) to be
		used as an index and added to the base (after being multiplied
		by the scale factor).
	3) The base field (bits 2, 1, and 0) indicate the general-purpose
		register (except EBP) containing the base address of a block of
		memory, such as the base address of an array or object.
	The address of the memory operand is calculated as:
		[base] + ([index] * 2^[SS]) + displacement (disp8 / disp32)
	(TODO: explain EBP/ESP)

<ol type="A"><li value="7">
	<h4 id="Immediate">Format of Machine Code Instruction</h4>
</li></ol>
<pre>
G) Immediate Operand Field:
	For many instructions, some of their forms specify the use of an
	immediate operand.  This means that the value to be used is part of
	the instruction itself, the byte or bytes in the instruction stream
	immediately following the opcode (and any other addressing bytes
	that are present).  These include arithmetic operations and jumps.
	For example, in the case of the conditional short jumps (opcodes
	0x71 - 0x7F and 0xE3), the immediate value, 1 byte long, is the byte
	following the instruction byte itself.

	Most often, an operand-size attribute of 16 bits specifies that the
	size of the immediate operand is 2 bytes, and an operand-size
	attribute of 32 bits specifies the size of the immediate operand as
	4 bytes.  The default operand size can be overridden by the use of
	the appropriate operand-size override prefix (See Part I, Section C).
</pre>

<p>
More information is included in the explanation section of each
	instruction; see there for more details.
<p>
Note that the use of multiple overrides per instruction is reserved.
	Certain override combinations are actually the start of the advanced
	mathematic instructions of the Pentium, P6, or P4 series (e.g. MMX,
	SIMD, SSE, etc.).
<p>
Note: FROM HERE ON, MUCH OF THE INFORMATION COMES FROM "THE IA-32
	PROGRAMMER'S GUIDE, VOLUME 2: INSTRUCTION REFERENCE" (C) INTEL,
	PROVIDED FREE OF CHARGE.  THE INFORMATION, HOWEVER, ONLY DESCRIBES
	THE BEHAVIOR OF PROCESSORS UP TO THE '486.
	The Pentium and later processors essentially use the same format,
	with many added capabilities.
