<ol type="A"><li value="1">
	<h4 id="Intro">Introduction</h4>
</li></ol>
<pre>
A) Each entry in this reference contains several bits of information,
	describing a single assembly language instruction.  An instruction
	may take one of several forms, depending on the location and type of
	the operands, each with its own opcode.  For each instruction, the
	various opcodes and their corresponding forms are given, as well as
	information about which processor flags are affected, what the
	instruction does, where the operands are (memory, register, etc.),
	and a detailed explanation.  In addition, the phrase of which the
	instruction name is a mnemonic is given, as well as aliases (other
	mnemonics for the same instruction).  As is normal for Intel, the
	instruction mnemonics are given in AT&T assembly format.
	This section contains an description of the format used for the
	reference entries.
</pre>

<ol type="A"><li value="2">
	<h4 id="Flags">Flag Information</h4>
</li></ol>
<pre>
B) Flag Information:
	The FLAGS (or EFLAGS) register contains several 1-bit flags that may
	be set or cleared based on the results of an instruction.  The 8086
	to 80286 processors contain the following flags, listed here with
	the corresponding 1-letter tag uses in this reference:
	O - Overflow Flag - set what a number wraps around or goes beyond a
		limit, such as when two positive integers are added and the
		result, if taken as signed, is negative.
	D - Direction Flag - directs whether string instructions will
		increment (clear) or decrement (set) the eSI/eDI registers.
		This flag is set and cleared directly with dedicated
		instructions, not as a side effect of other instructions (with
		the exception of instructions that affect the entire FLAGS
		register, such as POPF or IRET).
	I - Interrupt Flag - directs whether external hardware interrupts
		are recognized.  If cleared, external interrupts are ignored
		(except for NMI, #2).  This flag is not set or cleared as a side
		effect of other instructions, but rather with its own dedicated
		instructions.  This flag is usually set during normal operation,
		and is only cleared for sensitive operations.
	T - Trap Flag - used to control single-step mode, for use with a
		debugger.  If set, an interrupt #1 is executed after each
		instruction.  This flag is can only be set or cleared via an
		IRET instuction.
	S - Sign Flag - set to the high-order bit of the result of an ALU
		instructions.  If set, indicates that the result was negative.
	Z - Zero Flag - set to indicate that the result of an ALU operation
		was zero, cleared otherwise.  Also set by some instructions that
		test protected-mode permissions (LSL, LAR, VERR/VERW, etc.).
	A - Auxiliary Carry Flag - used to support BCD arithmetic.  Set if
		there was a carry into bit 3 of the result, cleared otherwise.
	P - Parity Flag - indicates whether the low-order byte of the result
		had an even (set) or odd (clear) number of bits set.  Often used
		with port I/O.
	C - Carry Flag - indicates whether an ALU operation generated a
		carry out of the high-order bit.  Also used by shifts, bit-tests,
		and error checking.

	The following symbols are used to indicate how each flag changes as
	a result of an instruction.  Each instruction explains how and when
	it changes the flags.  The symbols are:
	1 - The instruction always sets this flag (sets to 1).
	0 - The instruction always clears this flag (sets to 0).
	* - The instruction sets this flag to reflect the result.
	? - The instruction leaves this flag in an undefined state.

	The 16-bit FLAGS register is laid out as follows.  The bits marked
	"x" are not used; for their values, see the PUSHF/POPF instructions.
		+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
		| x | x | x | x | O | D | I | T | S | Z | x | A | x | P | x | C | 
		+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
	Bit: 15  14  13  12  11  10   9   8   7   6   5   4   3   2   1   0

	The 32-bit EFLAGS register on the 80386 and later processors include
	the 16-bit FLAGS register as the lower 16 bits, and extend the width
	with another 16 bits.  A description of the extended flags is beyond
	the scope of this reference.

<ol type="A"><li value="3">
	<h4 id="Opcodes">Explanation of Opcodes</h4>
</li></ol>
<pre>
C) Explanation of Opcodes:
	The opcode section contains the machine code for each version of an
	instruction.  These are the actual bytecodes understood directly by the
	processor, expressed in hexadecimal (though they are not prefixed with 0x).
	Some instruction opcodes are more than one byte long; in such cases, the
	byte lower in memory is listed first.  Most opcodes are followed by one or
	more symbols, which generally supply the types (sizes) and/or the locations
	of the operands.  The symbols used are:
	/digit (digit is a number from 0 to 7): the value of the reg field of the
		ModR/M byte.  The instruction has a single register-or-memory operand,
		addressed by the mod and r/m fields.  (There may be another, immediate,
		operand.)  The digit specifies 3 more bits of opcode, an extension to
		the instruction's opcode.
	/r: The instruction has two operands, specified in the ModR/M byte.  They
		are a register, encoded in the reg field, and a register/memory operand,
		encoded in the combined mod and r/m fields.  Exactly how the two
		operands are interpreted (e.g. source and destination) is specific to
		the instruction.
	ib, iw, id: a 1, 2, or 4 byte immediate operand, respectively.  The value
		to be used is read from the instruction stream, directly following the
		instruction opcode (and ModR/M byte, if any).  (Note: id, a 4-byte
		operand, is only available on the 386 and later processors.)
	cb, cw, cd, cp: a 1, 2, 4, or 6 byte immediate operand, where the value is
		used to calculate a pointer to executable code, as the target of a CALL
		or JUMP instructions.  The value may be offset to the current IP
		(instruction pointer), or it may be absolute.  The absolute forms may
		contain a segment address in addition to the segment offset.  (On the
		386 and later processors, cd may be a 32-bit offset;  in protected-mode
		only, cp is a 16-bit segment selector and a 32-bit segment offset.)
	+rb, +rw, +rd: The instruction has a register operand encoded directly in
		the opcode.  The register code is added to the base opcode to form the
		actual opcode.  (Note: +rd is only available on the 386 and later
		processors.)  The register codes are as follows:
			+------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
			| code |  0  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |  7  |
			+------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
			|  rb  |  AL |	CL |  DL |  BL |  AH |  CH |  DH |  BH |
			|  rw  |  AX |  CX |  DX |  BX |  SP |  BP |  SI |  DI |
			|  rd  | EAX | ECX | EDX | EBX | ESP | EBP | ESI | EDI |
			+------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
		The explanation section of each instruction where this is used includes
		the full list of opcodes and their corresponding operands.

<ol type="A"><li value="4">
	<h4 id="Operands">Explanation of Operands</h4>
</li></ol>
<pre>
D) Explanation of Operands:
	In the instruction syntax, several symbols are use to represent operands,
	the symbols describing what and where the operands are.  In the standard
	Intel syntax, the first operand is the DEST (destination) operand, and the
	second operand is the SRC (source) operand.  In the standard AT&T syntax,
	the order of the operands is reversed: the first operand is SRC, the second
	is DEST.  For example, the Intel "MOV AX, BX" means "Move (copy) to AX the
	value of BX" (in pseudo-code, this would be "AX = BX").  In AT&T syntax,
	this is expressed as "movw %bx, %ax", meaning "Move (copy) the value of BX
	to AX."
	In addition, AT&T syntax requires that all register names be prefixed with
	a percent sign ("%"), as in above "%bx" and "%ax", and that all constants,
	static, or immediate operands be prefixed with an ampersand ("&").  Also,
	the instruction mnemonic must have its size (Byte, Word, Long) affixed.  In
	the Intel syntax, this information is understood from the types or the
	operands - for memory references, the data definition directive (DB, DW, or
	DD) is used as a guide, but where ambiguous, BYTE PTR, WORD PTR, or DWORD
	PTR can be used.
	Another difference is how numbers are expressed: while both syntaxes
	understand numbers to be decimal (base 10) by default, in the Intel syntax,
	hexadecimal numbers are expressed by supplying an "H" or "h" suffix and
	binary numbers by a "B" or "b" suffix; the AT&T syntax expects hexadecimal
	numbers to be prefixed with "0x" or "0X". (To avoid being mistaken for
	labels, number is the Intel syntax must begin with a digit; if the first
	digit of a hexadecimal number is a letter, the number must begin with a 0,
	such as 0ABh instead of ABh.)  The effect of this is that the AT&T syntax
	is much simpler to parse, but perhaps less easy to read and write.
	In this reference, the Intel syntax is given.  The following symbols are
	used to indicate the instruction operands:
	r8 - an 8-bit (byte) register; one of AL, CL, DL, BL, AH, CH, DH, or BH.
	r16 - a 16-bit (word) register; one of AX, CX, DX, BX, SP, BP, SI, or DI.
	r32 - a 32-bit (double-word/long) register; one of EAX, ECX, EDX, EBX, ESP,
		EBP, ESI, or EDI (only on the 386 and later processors).
	imm8 - an immediate 8-bit (byte) value, 0x00 to 0xFF.  imm8 is a signed
		number in the range {-128 to +127}.  This value may be sign-extended to
		a larger size (16 or 32 bits) - the upper byte(s) filled with a copy of
		the sign-bit (bit 7) - to match the size of the other operand in some
		arithmetic operations.
	imm16 - an immediate 16-bit (2 bytes, or a word) value, 0x0000 to 0xFFFF.
		imm16 is a signed integer in the range {-32,768 to +32,767}.
	imm32 - an immediate 32-bit (4 bytes, or a double-word or long) value,
		0x0000'0000 to 0xFFFF'FFFF.  imm32 is a signed integer in the range
		{-2,147,483,648 to +2,147,483,647}.  (386 an later processors only.)
	r/m8 - an 8-bit (byte) value, addressed by the mod and r/m fields of the
		ModR/M byte: either the contents of a byte register (see r8), or a byte
		from memory.
	r/m16 - a 16-bit (word) value, either in a word register (see r16) or in
		two consecutive bytes in memory.  The address of the low-order byte is
		given by the mod and r/m fields of the ModR/M byte, and the high-order
		byte is one byte higher in memory (little-endian).
	r/m32 - a 32-bit (double-word/long) value, either in a double-word register
		(see r32) or in 4 consecutive bytes in memory, the low-order byte of
		which is addressed by the mod and r/m fields of the ModR/M byte.
	rel8 - an 8-bit signed immediate value, in the range {-128 to +127} (0x00
		to 0xFF), specifying a relative address in the same code segment,
		offset from the first byte in the following instruction.  The value is
		sign-extended and added to the eIP register, to effect a short jump.
	rel16 - a 16-bit signed value, in the range {-32,768 to +32,767} (0x0000 to
		0xFFFF) specifying a near (same code segment) relative address, offset
		from the first byte of the following instruction.  The word value is
		added to the eIP register, to effect a near jump.
	rel32 - a 32-bit signed immediate value, in the range {-2,147,483,648 to 
		+2,147,483,647} (0x0000'0000 to 0xFFFF'FFFF), specifying a near (same
		code segment) relative address, offset from the first byte of the
		following instruction.  The double-word value is added to the EIP
		register, to effect a near jump (on the 386 and later only).
	ptr16:16 - an immediate far pointer, consisting of two parts: a 16-bit
		segment selector (or base address, in real mode), and a 16-bit offset
		within that segment.  Read as a double-word in little-endian form, the
		low-order word (lowest in memory, earlier in the instruction stream) is
		the offset within the segment, and the high-order word (highest in
		memory, later in the instruction stream) is the segment selector value.
		Generally, the segment selector indicates a code segment, intended for
		the CS register.
	ptr16:32 - an immediate far pointer (on the 386 and later processors only),
		consisting of a 16-bit segment selector or value, generally for the CS
		register, and a 32-bit offset within that segment.  The offset is lower
		in memory (earlier in the instruction stream), low-order byte first.
	m16:16 - a far pointer stored in memory (addressed by the ModR/M byte),
		consisting of a 16-bit segement selector (stored lower in memory) and a
		16-bit offset (or address) within that segment.
	m16:32 - a 6-byte far pointer, stored in memory and addressed by the ModR/M
		byte, consisting of (in order) a 16-bit segment selector and a 32-bit
		offset within that segment.
	m8 - an 8-bit (byte) operand of a string instruction.
	m16 - a 16-bit (word) operand of a string instruction.
	m32 - a 32-bit (long) operand of a string instruction.
		Note: the m8, m16, and m32 operands are addressed by the register pairs
		DS:eSI (use of the DS segement register may be overridden) for reading,
		and ES:eDI (ES cannot be overridden if there are two operands) for
		writing.
	Sreg - a (16-bit) segement selector register.  (See tables 1 and 2 for the
		register codes of the segment selector registers.)
	m16&16 - a pair of (16-bit) words, stored in memory and addressed by the
		ModR/M byte.  This operand form is used by the BOUND instruction to
		give the lower bound (the word lower in memory) and the upper bound
		(the word higher in memory) of an array or memory block. 
	m32&32 - a pair of (32-bit) double-words, stored in memory and addressed by
		the ModR/M byte.  This operand form is used by the BOUND instruction on
		the 386 and later processors, to give the lower and upper bounds of an
		array or memory block.
	m16&32 - a 6-byte block consisting of a word followed by a double-word,
		stored at the memory location addressed by the ModR/M byte.  This
		operand form is used by the LIDT/LGDT instructions to provide a word
		for the LIMIT field and a double-word for the BASE field of the Global
		and Interrupt Descriptor Table Registers.
	moffs8 - a byte in memory, addressed by an immediate near pointer (16- or
		32-bit), which is an offset into the current data (or overridden)
		segment; used by some forms of the MOV instruction.
	moffs16 - a word in memory, addressed by an immediate near (16 or 32-bit)
		pointer, an offset into the current data (or overridden) segment; used
		by some forms of the MOV instruction.
	moffs32 - a double-word (long) in memory, addressed by an immediate near
		pointer, an offset into the current data (or overridden) segment; used
		by some forms of the MOV instruction.

Note: The operand size attribute of the instruction, whether specified by the
	Code Segment status or by an override, indicates whether the operand is
	16-bits long (r16, imm16, r/m16, rel16, ptr16:16, m16:16, m16, m16&16, and
	moffs16) or 32-bits long (r32, imm32, r/m32, rel32, ptr16:32, m16:32, m32,
	m32&32, and moffs32).  The address-size attribute, whether specified by the
	Code Segment status or by an override, indicates whether the near pointer
	used by moffs16 or moffs32 is 16 bits or 32 bits (2 bytes or 4 bytes) long.
	The operand of the LGDT and LIDT instructions is m16&32 regardless of the
	operand-size attribute, although the high-order byte (bits 40 - 47) are not
	used if the operand-size is 16 bits. (In effect, it is read as m16&24.)
